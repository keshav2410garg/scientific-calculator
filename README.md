"Ever wondered what it takes to build your own calculator? Well, what if we tell you that all you need is a programming language like C++ and some basic knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. Still seems unreal? We'll walk you through it. This repository will not only brush up your knowledge of C++ but also educate you about concepts of OOPs and how they can be modeled and replicated with real world examples."

## FEATURES:</br>
- The user will be able to perform both basic and scientific calculations using this calculator. For example: "+" Addition, "-" Subtraction, "X" Multiplication,"/" Division and Trignometric operations.</br>
- The calculator comes with an add on memory feature. With the help of this feature user can store previous calculations and their results which can be referred to later for ease in calculations.</br>

## SET UP:</br>
1. Fork and clone the repository</br>

     git clone https://github.com/keshav2410garg/scientific-calculator.git
     
2. Move to the directory</br>
