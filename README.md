**OVERVIEW:**</br>
Ever wondered of making your own calculator that will be build on your basic understanding of first language you learned that is C++ and basic concepts of OOP's programming.
This repository focuses on making your own calculator on C++ that will not only brush up your C++ skills but also be based on object oriented programming concepts and how these concepts can be modeled and replicated with real world examples. This will also make use of basic data stuctures to store the results.

**FEATURES:**</br>
- The user will be able to perform both basic and scientific calculations using this calculator. For example "+" Adddition "-" Subraction Multiplication "X" as well as scientific calculation like trignometric operations.</br>
- The calculator has an add on of  memory feature. Using this feature user will be able to store all the previous calculations made and  their results which user can refer to perform further calculations.</br>

**HOW IT WORKS:** </br>
 - The user will enter the input number for which He needs to perform calculation.

**SET UP:**</br>
1. Fork and clone the repository</br>

     git clone https://github.com/keshav2410garg/scientific-calculator.git
     
2. Move to the directory</br>

     cd scitific-calculator
     
**PROJECT STRUCTURE**</br>
- **inc**: This is populated by the header files used in project
- **obj**: It contains all the object of the .cpp files.
- **src**: It will be populated by all the .cpp files used to build calculator
